"Contacts" web application.


The project requirements:

The user should be able to add the contact information where:
name - is required
email - is required
phone - optional
Users should be able to favorite the contact.
Users should be able to see the list of all contacts and list of favorite contacts
In the contacts list, the user should be able to toggle "favorite" on and off. If the contact was unfavorited, it should disappear from the list of favorite contacts.
You should be able to modify existing contact.
The data should be persistent so you might want to use the localStore for simplicity.


Tech stack:

You can use the language of your choice but we would prefer TypeScript.
You can use any framework of your choice.
Feel free to use any UI libraries of your choice, but would be great if you could showcase your CSS knowledge. You can use any preprocessors like SCSS, LESS or others.


Things which we will care about are:

The source code quality. It should be well formatted and easy to review
The UI. The application should look nice (subjectively) and be easy to use. Ideally mobile friendly.
The form fields validation
Commits quality - Commits titles should follow the angular conventions. Each logical task should be in a separate commit.
Configured linter would be welcome but not required
Some unit and/or e2e tests are welcome but not required
